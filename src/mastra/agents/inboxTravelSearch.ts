/**
 * Mastra requires tools to be defined using Zod, a TypeScript-first schema validation library
 * that has become the standard for runtime type checking. Zod is particularly valuable because it:
 * - Provides runtime type safety and validation
 * - Offers excellent TypeScript integration with automatic type inference
 * - Has a simple, declarative API for defining schemas
 * - Is widely adopted in the TypeScript ecosystem
 *
 * Arcade provides `toZodToolSet` to convert our tools into Zod format, making them compatible
 * with Mastra.
 *
 * The `executeOrAuthorizeZodTool` helper function simplifies authorization.
 * It checks if the tool requires authorization: if so, it returns an authorization URL,
 * otherwise, it runs the tool directly without extra boilerplate.
 *
